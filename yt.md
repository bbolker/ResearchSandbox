Abstract
=======

Understanding how the information circulated and evolved on the social platform is essential for an effective public health campaign.  

Background
==========

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world in early 2020, causing widespread panic.  It brought an unprecedented global public health crisis that drew comparisons to the 1918 Spanish flu (e.g., @KrisOgun20; @RobeTehr20), causing economic and social disruption and uncovering inequalities in health care [@GSchl20; @KrisOgun20; @NicoAlsa20].  COVID-19 was the first pandemic to occur at a time when social media platforms were used on a massive scale, enabling an “infodemic” of conflicting information which undermined the global response to COVID-19 and jeopardized measures to control the pandemic [@WHO20].  Social media contributes to how the public views and responds to a health crisis [@CineQuat20; @ChanWinn18; @ChoiYoo17; @GabaOyey21; @LiMa21] and affects policy responses and mitigation of epidemic spread [@ChenWang21; @HsuChen17].

Results:
========

Figure @fig:dotSource shows videos broken down by video source, in decreasing order of number of coded videos. Straight news (e.g., ABC news, CNN, Fox News) contributed the largest number of coded videos (65%), and the public health authorities (WHO and Governments) combined (3%), the least. Entertainment news (e.g., Last week tonight with John Oliver) received the highest median views of 2.6 millions per coded video (see Table 1 in the supplements). Kruskal-Wallis $p < 0.001$ for overall differences between medians, indicating an ability to see some clear differences among view counts for the different video sources.
