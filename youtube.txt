Final output for this project is .docx. We are also potentially interested in producing nice html or pdf for development.

For .docx we have a tex route and a direct route

There are also questions about pandoc filters vs. options. Or something

## Control figure-caption placement

## Control citation style

## ⇒ tex ⇒ pdf

Seems to work good; didn't mess with reference style yet

## ⇒ tex ⇒ docx

References are weird and not trying to follow supplied style; crossrefs are good

## md ⇒ docx

References look good; crossrefs don't work

## Amazing solution

* Made all the refs work by updating pandoc directly from repo and using the right finicky recipe (xnos first among other things)
* Put the caption up by manipulating an expanded md file
	* The best way I found to expand the md file was to:
		* make the docx
		* make it back into md
		* manipulate the media directory inside the docx xml
